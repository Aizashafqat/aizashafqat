### Hi there, I’m Aiza Shafqat 👋  
_A Computer Science Student | UI/UX Designer | Aspiring Android Developer_

---

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a semester project: a smart Android app that captures text via images or notes and generates clean summaries and key sentences — helping users save time and effort.
- 🌱 I'm diving deep into **Kotlin**, **XML**, and **Android Studio** (yes, it’s my first time and I’m loving the challenge!).
- 🎨 As a UI/UX designer, I focus on **human-centered design**, combining functionality with aesthetics. I believe every pixel should have a purpose.
- 🧠 I’m passionate about solving real-world problems with **technology**, especially by blending **AI**, **design thinking**, and practical development.
- 👩‍💻 I enjoy creating **intuitive user experiences**, and I value accessibility, minimalism, and clarity in every design.
- 🖼️ I also run a side hustle where I create and sell **digital prints and creative products** — it keeps my creativity flowing!
- 🧩 Always curious about new tech — from **machine learning models** to **modular app architecture**.
- 💬 Ask me about:
  - UI/UX design principles and tools
  - Designing for mobile apps
  - Getting started with Android development
  - Turning creative ideas into digital products
- 📫 How to reach me: aizashafqat44@gmail.com • linkedin.com/in/aiza-shafqat
- ⚡ Fun fact: My presentations are usually in a chill mix of English and Urdu — because why not make things effective *and* fun?
